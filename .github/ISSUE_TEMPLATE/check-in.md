<!-- you will create ONE check-in issue per module

  each week of the module you will add a new section to this ONE issue including

  make your issue easy to find:

  - milestone: the current module
  - assign: yourself
-->

<!-- include a link to your fork of the module repository -->

> [my fork of the exercises repo](_)

## Study Plan

<!-- create a study plan for yourself in this module -->
<!-- you can start your list by making checklist from the module's suggested study -->
<!--  one check-box per topic is enough, no need to list each link -->
<!--  check off a topic when you are confident applying the concept in your projects -->
<!-- but don't stop there!  this is your study plan, make it work for you -->

<!--  ---------------------------------------


  copy this template into a new comment each week and fill in your answers
  each week add a new `week-x` label when your check-in comment is ready for review

  In weeks there is a project:

    be sure to look through the exercises before starting the project. 
    You don’t need to finish them before the project,
    but starting them will help understand the project. 

    your goal each week is to finish the project
    working on exercises should help you finish the project, not get in the way
    you can always come back to study the exercises laters
