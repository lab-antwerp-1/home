# Class Admin

An HYF class repository is used to for students and coaches to share feedback
and keep a record of each student's progress. Your class repository will serve 3
main roles:

- _Homework, Questions and Feedback_: for this role, the repository is basically
  an issues-only repo. All the heavy-lifting is done with issue templates,
  labels/milestones and a project board. Most of the links in the main README
  are just filters over issues/PRs in the class repository, you could in
  principle run your class without the README by manually filtering the issues.
- _Names & Faces_: The README will contain each student/coach's name & avatar,
  plus a few links to learn more about them. There is also a folder called
  `/student-bios` where each student is expected to send a PR with a short bio
  about themselves.
- _Modules & References_: Students and coaches can find all the study materials
  for HYF by links in the README. In the _Modules_ sections you can find a link
  to each module repository, and in the _HYF Links_ section you can find a link
  to the main HYF Study Reference and the Home GitBook. There is also a
  `/shared-notes` folder available if a class is motivated to build a shared
  study guide.

This folder contains the scripts and assets to manage your class repository.
After the initial setup, you should only need to use this folder to add a
coach/student, or to remove a coach/student. The only thing you'll need to do
manually is to adjust the .json files in `/data`, everything else is managed
with NPM scripts (all of that is explained in this README).

## Getting Started

There will be three main steps to set up your own HYF class. The 1st is on
GitHub directly, the 2nd & 3rd you will need to do locally:

### 1. Setup Repository

> scroll down to [HYF Workflows](hyf-workflows) to learn more about setting up
> your repo

Using this repo as a template you can start a new repository to host your own
HYF class. After creating a new repository from this template, you will to do
some configuration:

- create a team for your class in the github organization, add this repository
  to the team, and add each student as a collaborator in the team with _write_
  access (otherwise they won't have full access to the project board)
- create the labels & milestones your class will need
- create some project boards:
  - _deliverables_: for all homework issues
  - _side-projects_: for any fun projects students want to work on
- turn on GitHub pages to make the class randomizer live
- turn on Discussions in your repo settings
- set PRs to `master`/`main` branch to require review before merging

### 2. Clone & Reset

1. clone the repo
2. `npm run reset` (more about this in [NPM Scripts](#npm-scripts))

### 3. Update Data

> scroll down to [Class Data](#class-data) to learn more about each data file's
> schema

You will need to manually update the .json files in the `./data` folder. Each
time you update the data you will need to re-render the README. If you are using
the standard HYF Curriculum, you will only need to update 3 of the .json files :

- `index.json`: a small file, it's the main configuration point for all links
  that will be generated in the README file.
- `students.json`: an array of student objects that will be used to render the
  _Students_ section of the README.
- `coaches.json`: an array of coach objects for rendering the _Coaches_ section.
  The only difference between a coach and student object is that coaches have an
  optional "modules" property to indicate which modules they have helped to
  teach.

If you want to customize your HYF course further by adjusting the modules you
can take a look at [modules.json](#modulesjson) to learn about your options.

### 4. Render READMEs

> scroll down to [NPM Scripts](#npm-scripts) to learn more about each script

Once your data is filled in all that's left to do is:

- `npm run build`
  1. fetch the avatars for all students and coaches
  2. render the new class repo
- commit changes
- push to remote

You're ready to go, you've started your own HYF class! Now all the real work
begins :)

## HYF Workflows

HYF is built around GitHub project management workflows. To use the workflows
described in [home.hackyourfuture.be](https://home.hackyourfuture.be) you will
need to do some one-time-only setup.

### Contributors

Add all your coaches and students as contributors with _write_ access in the
repo. Without (at least) write access they will not be able to use the issues
and project board.

This is the only step in _HYF Workflows_ that you may need to revisit after
class starts as you add/remove coaches & students.

### Labels

HYF workflows and the links rendered in this repo's README rely on certain
labels being present. You can create them all at once using whatever colors you
like

- `check-in`
  - used by students to label module check-in issues
- `roll-call`
  - for roll-call issues created before each class
- `chapter-1`, `chapter-2`, ... up to the longest module in your curriculum
  - used to label `roll-call` & `deliverable` issues
  - and by students to indicate when they've updated their `check-in` issue each
    chapter of a module
- `checked-1`, `checked-2`, ... up to the longest module in your curriculum
  - used by coaches to indicated a check-in has been checked
- `deliverable`, `individual`, `group`
  - used to label all deliverables issues, which will be placed on the main
    deliverables board
- `vocabulary`, `snippets`, `chill-zone`
  - for issues & PRs to a folder in this repo

Students will also use the `question` and `help-wanted` labels, but those come
standard in GitHub repos.

### Milestones

Add one milestone for each module in your curriculum. Careful! the milestone's
name must _exactly_ match the module's name from the `modules.json` data file.

If you want you can add due dates for when each module ends. This can help to
keep track of overall progress through the course.

### Project Boards

You will want to create a few projects boards (described in **1. Setup
Repository**). After creating the project boards you will need to update the
"project" property of `index.json` so the module links will filter for the
correct project board.

#### Deliverables

You will want these columns in your class project board. Students move their
issues to the first 4 columns, coaches move issues to the last two columns:

1. **TODO**
2. **DOING**
3. **READY FOR REVIEW**
4. **NEEDS REVISION**
5. **DONE**

#### Side Projects

There are no real requirements for this project board, it exists for fun and to
encourage students to collaborate outside of course work. Here's an idea for
columns in this project:

1. **PLANNING**: backlog, dev strategy, issues, ...
2. **IN PROGRESS**: Moving issues, reviewing PRs, the fun stuff
3. **MVP**: the "Must Have" PRs are merged
4. **FANCY TIME**: working on "Should Have"s and "Could Have"s

## Class Data

All the data for your class is managed with these 4 .json files. it's not a
fancy system but it's simple to host, easy enough to maintain, and makes it easy
to use the class repo offline. You could imagine building a CMS over this (even
a simple one who's code lives in the `/admin` directory) but that's for another
day.

### index.json

The object in this file has only 5 recognized properties, all are used to render
links in the README.

There are separate entries for the `modulesUserName` and the `repoUserName` so
that this class repo can be reused by anyone with a GitHub account. If you want
to run your own HYF using our modules, you can leave the `modulesUserName` as
"HackYourFutureBelgium" (so module links reference our repos), and update
`repoUserName` to point to your account so that all issue filters open in your
repo.

To note: `modulesUserName` is a defaults, you can individually configure module
links to reference any GitHub account or have their projects tracked on
different project boards. That's covered in [modules.json](#modulesjson)

```js
{
  "orgName": "the GitHub organization used to host this class",
  "repoName": "the name of this repository",
  "curriculumUserName": "the GitHub username where the course materials is hosted", /*
          can be over-ridden in each module's data
  */
  "curriculumOrigin": "the base URL where the course is hosted, used to render links to each module",
  "boards": [
    {
      "name": "the board's name on github",
      "number": 0 // the board's number on githug
    }
  ]
}
```

### students.json

A thumbnail intro to each student will be rendered into the README. This
thumbnail will include:

- the student's github avatar - unless an "imgURL" exists
- their name, rendered as a link to their student bio
- their github username
- their home page - `username.github.io` by default
- filters for all authored & assigned issues/PRs

```js
{
  "name": "the student's name",
  "userName": "the student's GitHub username",
  // optional:
  "homePage": "a url", // (optional) will be used instead of `username.github.io`
  "imgURL": "where their photo lives, will over-ride fetching their avatar from this repo"
}
```

### coaches.json

Basically the same a student. A thumbnail intro to each student will be rendered
into the README. This thumbnail will include:

- the coach's github avatar
- their name (not a link)
- their github username
- their home page (only if their data entry includes a "homePage" property)
- filters for all authored & assigned issues/PRs
- a list of all the modules they have helped with (if "modules" exists and is an
  array)

```js
{
  "name": "the coach's name",
  "userName": "the student's GitHub username",
  // optional
  "homePage": "(optional) url to the coach's preferred home page (portfolio, linkedin, github, ...)",
  "imgURL": "where their photo lives, will over-ride fetching their github avatar",
  "modules": [
    "the name of each module they helped with",
    "these can be written however, they aren't used to generate any links"
  ]
}
```

### modules.json

This file contains an array of module objects used to render each module's links
in the README. Module objects have the most configuration options of all the
data types in the class repo to give you the flexibility in how you structure
your curriculum, host your content, and structure the assignments for each
module.

With the basic configurations only (the non-optional properties), the README
will contain these links for each module:

- link to the module repository, configurable with the "userName" property
- a link to the project board filtered for this module's milestone
- a link to this module's milestone overview

If a module has "chapters", this will also be rendered:

- the number of chapters
- a filter for all check-in issues from this module
- a filter for all roll-call issues from this module

Additional links can be included using the "filters" and "links" properties.

```js
{
  "milestone": 1, // the number of this module's milestone in the repo
  "name": "the name of this module", // you will need to use exactly this name when creating your milestones
  // the remaining properties are optional:
  "chapters": 1 /* how many chapters of class/homework there are for the module.
                if a module has no chapters, then no check-in or roll-call links will be rendered */,
  "project": 1 /* the project board to link to for this module's assignments
                  if absent, the index.json's "project" number will be used */,
  "userName": "a github username" /* the user account hosting this module's repository
                                    if not provided, "modulesUserName" from index.json will be used*/,
  "url": "the URL where this module is hosted ", /*
                                    if not provided, urls will be generated as described above
  */
  "filters": [
    /* any extra issue filter links to be added under this module's name
      options are optional and based on GitHub query parameters (except for "text") */
    {
      "text": "bio pull requests", // the text people will click on
      "labels": ["hyf-prep-work"], // labels to add into the filter
      "milestone": "name", // the milestone to use, if non is provided the module name will be used
      "is": ["pr", "issue", "open", "closed"]
    }
  ],
  "links": [
    {
      "text": "words to appear",
      "href": "url to open"
    }
  ]
}
```

## NPM Scripts

Once your class data is set up in the .json files you can do everything else you
need with these NPM scripts. When you first set up your class repo you will want
to:

1. `npm run reset`
2. update your class's .json data files
3. `npm run build`

Later you will only need to use these scripts when you update the class data
files:

- _without fetching avatars_: `npm run render`, re-render the README using the
  same avatars
- _with fetching avatars_: `npm run build`, re-fetch all avatars. practical for
  when you add someone or when someone updates the GitHub profile

### `npm run reset`

> Caution! this script will clear out your `coaches.json` and `students.json`
> data files!

Run this script if you've just created your repo and are starting a new class.
It will clear out and reset all the files/folders you need to give your class a
clean start:

- empties the old images from the `./avatars` directory
- resets `coaches.json` and `students.json` to empty arrays
- clears out everything in the `../student-bios` directory
- re-seeds the main README and the `../student-bios` README with the starter
  markdown

### `npm run fetch`

Downloads the GitHub avatars for all students and coaches. Saves them as `.jpeg`
files in `./avatars/students` and `./avatars/coaches`.

This script will overwrite old avatars with the same username, but will not
clear out avatars from students/coaches that have been taken out of your data.

### `npm run render`

Uses the class data to render the main README. You can render the main README
without fetching the avatars, but all the images will be missing. These things
will be rendered:

- a filter for all open issues with the `question` label will be rendered at the
  top of the file
- the main header will be set to the repo's name in index.json
- all modules and their links will be rendered based on `modules.json`
- all coach & student thumbnails

### `npm run build`

`npm run fetch && npm run render`
