# Snippets

In this folder you and your classmates will write and share useful code
snippets: Bash, Git HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, all of it. As you work through
HYF you will notice that there's certain things you do often with code, instead
of re-inventing the wheel you can share a snippet?

Why write your own snippets when there are already so many out there? Because
[explaining something helps you understand it](https://www.livescience.com/34000-explaining-helps-understand.html).
Explanations you read or watch online will often make sense as you follow along,
but when you try to give the same explanation later you realize that you miss
many small details. By re-writing your own snippets you will be forced to
explain and understand the problem better than if you just copy-pasted someone
else's code.

So don't be shy! Share all the helpful snippets you come across, big or small.
Did someone already submit a snippet that does the same thing as yours? No
problem! Having more than one way to do the same thing can be very helpful.

## Contributing

Everyone in your class is encouraged to contribute to this guide. There is a
**Snippets** project board in your class repository that you can use to organize
your issues, pull requests, and discussions. You don't need to write a
development strategy or main plan, it's better to let this folder grow naturally
as you explore JS.

No contribution is too small! The only rule is that everything you put
everything you are doing on the **Snippets** project board. If you aren't
comfortable writing your own snippets there's still a lot you can contribute.
You can:

- help review Pull Requests
- contribute extra study references to an existing snippet
- fix spelling or grammar mistakes

## Translations

We came from all over the world to learn together at HackYourFuture. In the same
way, we all study together in english but have our own mother tongues. You are
encouraged to study in any language you prefer as long as we come together and
share our learning in english. Translating from english to your mother tongue
can be a good way to study, and will definitely help others who are struggling
with programming!

Contributions in all languages are welcome as long as you follow these file
naming conventions:

- File names should always be written in english using the same name as the
  english file
- File extensions should show which language they are written in (except for
  english which is the default)
- Files cannot be translated until there is an english version, so that everyone
  can share this study guide
