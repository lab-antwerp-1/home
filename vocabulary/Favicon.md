# html favicon

## A favicon is a small image displayed next to the page title in the browser tab

## It is a small image, so it should be a simple image with high contrast

## To add a favicon to your website, either save your favicon image to the root directory of your webserver, or create a folder in the root directory called images, and save your favicon image in this folder. A common name for a favicon image is "favicon.ico" Next, add a `link` element to your "index.html" file, after the `title` element, like this

<!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
           <title>My Page Title</title>
           <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.ico">
       </head>
        <body>

         <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

        </body>
        </html>
