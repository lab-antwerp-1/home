# Vocabulary

I.T. is a new language, the words may come from English but they often mean
something completely different.

Fill this folder with files of vocabulary lists, organized with one file per
topic. You can send a PR each time you learn an important word, find a helpful
definition, or would like to improve an existing definition.

As the course goes on, your understanding of the concepts and vocabulary will
also progress. If you think the files or lists should be reorganized send a PR!
Just be sure to get plenty of feedback before merging your refactored lists,
your classmates will also need to use these lists.

Translations are more than welcome!
