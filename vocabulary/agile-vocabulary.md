# Agile Vocabulary for Developers

## Agile Mindset

An Agile mindset is a set of attitudes that an Agile or Scrum team should have towards their work.

These attitudes are inspired by Agile values and principles, such as:

- Respect
- Collaboration
- Continuous improvement
- Focus on delivering value

## Agile Software Development

Agile Software Development is a project management technique that allows developers to create a working software model in just a few weeks.

An Agile team breaks down in their project into smaller development cycles called iterations or sprints.

At the end of the iteration, the Agile team is able to deliver working software with just the essential features. Users give their feedback and suggestions, and the Agile team includes it in future iterations, like us!

This cycle continues until you’ve created a final software that delights your customers.

Over the years, it has split into different frameworks and methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, Lean, and XP.

## Backlog

It’s a list of new product features, updates, bug fixes, etc. that are required by the user.

At the start of every iteration, the product owner decides which backlog items the team needs to work on. After every iteration, the backlog is regularly updated with user suggestions and new features.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous integration is an Agile practice where developers constantly add their code to the main system.

How does it work?

Development professionals work independently on a feature. Once a feature is completed, it’s tested for any bugs.

Only after it’s passed the automated test is it added to the final software.

## Iteration

It’s a period of time in which an Agile team needs to develop working software. An iteration generally lasts for around 2-4 weeks for Kanban and Scrum teams.

## User story

It’s a brief description of a specific product feature or a function that customers would find helpful.

A user story looks something like this:

‘As (user name/type), I want to (do a thing), so I can (achieve a goal).

For example:

Let’s say you’re tasked with developing an app for Batman!.

So a sample user story would be like:

‘As Bruce Wayne, I want to be able to get a ‘Bat Signal’ notification on my app, so I can save the day.’
