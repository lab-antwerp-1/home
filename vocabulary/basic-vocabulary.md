# Basic Vocabulary for Developers

## HTML

“Hypertext Markup Language.” The coding language used to build a website in terms of both form and function.

## CSS

“Cascading Style Sheet.” Code that tells browsers how to display a webpage for the end user. This programming formats fonts, colors, and other visual elements.

## Front End

The part of the website or app that the user sees. If the back end of your website is everything behind-the-scenes, this is what happens onstage.

## Back End

All of the behind-the-scenes digital operations that it takes to keep the front end of a website running, such as the coding, style, and plugins. If the front end of your website is what the audience sees onstage, the back end encompasses the stagehands, makeup artists, costumers, tech crew, stage managers, etc. simultaneously running the show from backstage.
