# CSS Colors

There are four ways to represent color in CSS:

## 1

Named colors—there are more than 140 named colors like red, green, blue.

## 2

Hexadecimal or hex colors. Hexadecimal is a number system which has sixteen
digits, 0 to 9 followed by “A” to “F”. Hex values always starts with # and
specify values of red, blue, and green using hexadecimal numbers such as 23F41A.
Six-digit hex values with duplicate values for each RGB value can be shorted to
three digits.

## 3

RGB colors use the rgb() syntax with one value for red, one value for blue and
one value for green. RGB values range from 0 to 255 and look like this: rgb(7,
210, 50).

## 4

HSL stands for hue (the color itself), saturation (the intensity of the color),
and lightness (how light or dark a color is). Hue ranges from 0 to 360 and
saturation and lightness are both represented as percentages like this: hsl(200,
20%, 50%). You can add opacity to color in RGB and HSL by adding a fourth value,
a, which is represented as a percentage.
