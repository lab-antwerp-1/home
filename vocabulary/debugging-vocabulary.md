# Debugging Vocabulary

## Code Debugging

- Programming code might contain syntax errors, or logical errors. Many of these errors are difficult to diagnose. Often, when programming code contains errors, nothing will happen. There are no error messages, and you will get no indications where to search for errors. Searching for (and fixing) errors in programming code is called code debugging.

## The console.log() Method

- Prints text to the console. Useful for debugging. You can use console.log() to display JavaScript values in the console.

## Setting Breakpoints

- In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code. At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values. After examining values, you can resume the execution of code (typically with a play button).
