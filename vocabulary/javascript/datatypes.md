# JavaScript Datatypes

In JavaScript, there are seven fundamental data types:

## Number

Any number, including numbers with decimals: 4, 8, 1516, 23.42.

## String

Any grouping of characters on your keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols,
etc.) surrounded by single quotes: ' ... ' or double quotes " ... ". Though we
prefer single quotes. Some people like to think of string as a fancy word for
text.

## Boolean

This data type only has two possible values— either true or false (without
quotes). It’s helpful to think of booleans as on and off switches or as the
answers to a “yes” or “no” question.

## Null

This data type represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented
by the keyword null (without quotes).

## Undefined

This data type is denoted by the keyword undefined (without quotes). It also
represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than null.

## Symbol

A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique identifiers, useful in more
complex coding. No need to worry about these for now.

## Object

Collections of related data.
