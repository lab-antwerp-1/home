## Errors

     An error message box is displayed when something in the script's format disallows it to run.
     The two type of errors you'll encounter are called RunTime and Syntax errors.

## Run-Time Error

     A Run-Time error is an error that is produced when incorrect terms are used in the Javascript code.
     An incorrect command or out of sequence format will throw this type of error.

## Syntax Error

     A Syntax error is produced when a script's format or shape is incorrect, a misspelling is found, or
     text is not recognized. Syntax errors are also thrown when you have opened a command, but then do not close it.
