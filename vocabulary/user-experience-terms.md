# User Experience Terms

## 1. MOOD BOARD

Mood boards are collections of content (images, materials, pieces of text) used
to represent the visual style of a website—or any creative project— (color
palette, images, icons, and fonts) in pre-production. The style represented on a
mood board is then translated into digital form by visual designers.

## 2. SITEMAPS

Sitemaps are outlines or maps of the pages that make up a website. They show the
relationship between the pages and links, apps, videos, or other components, and
can take the form of a document or its own page on the website.

## 3. USER INTERFACE (UI)

User interface includes all the parts of a website, app, computer, smartphone,
etc. that the user can manipulate and interact with. Display and touch screens,
website menus, keyboards, your cursor—these are all part of a user interface.

## 4. USER EXPERIENCE (UX)

UX describes the emotions, attitudes, and ease-of-use a person has when using a
product or service. UX Design is the practice of using design to improve
communication between a product and its user in order to enhance the user’s
overall experience.

## 5. USER FLOW

User flow is the path typical users take when starting on a website and moving
toward an action on the site. Creating a smooth path that is intuitive for users
to follow is part of user experience (UX) design.

## 6. USER PERSONA

Personas are theoretical user profiles created by UX and web designers to define
what kind of user a website is being built for and what their needs are. User
personas are created using demographic information, user research, and analysis
of customer experience metrics.

## 7. USER RESEARCH

User research is the process of investigating how users behave on a website and
examining how that behavior can lead to a better website experience and design.

## 8. WIREFRAME

Wireframes are sketches of the key information that goes on each page of a
website, essentially showing the site or page’s “skeleton.” Designers can then
use this sketch as a starting point for laying out a website. These can be made
in programs or written on a napkin—we’ve seen it all.
