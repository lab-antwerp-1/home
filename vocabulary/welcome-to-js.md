# JavaScript Vocabulary

## Block

In JavaScript a block is delimited curly braces ({}). An if statement contains a block, a for loop contains a block.

## Strict mode

Strict mode is an ECMAScript 5.1 new feature, which causes the JavaScript runtime to catch more errors, but it helps you improve the JavaScript code by denying undeclared variables and other things that might cause overlooked issues like duplicated object properties and other subtle things. Hint: use it. The alternative is “sloppy mode” which is not a good thing even looking at the name we gave it.

## Method

A Method is a command that tells how an object is to be acted upon.

## Document

This is an object name that refers specifically to the HTML document that contains the Javascript.

## Variable

A symbol representing a quantity that assumes a range of values.
